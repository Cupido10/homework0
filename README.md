## Introduction
When I started getting involved in Deep learning, I have known a novel CNN architecture called "ResNets", currently the prevalent architecture in computer vision. And recently, I have reading some paper works related to object detection, and I realize that I have seen this author's name many times before. This man who contributes lots of papers in object detection( ex: Faster-RCNN、R-FCN、Mask R-CNN) and now joins Facebook AI Research (FAIR) as a Research Scientist.
